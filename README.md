# FinTracker-RoR-Capstone-Project
> In this project, I implemented an MVP(minimum viable product) with RoR, a mobile app called FinTracker to help track expenses. Here your expenses are grouped in different categories(groups) and the app helps you track what you have spent for the different categories.
